# PkemonApi

This project was generated using Ruby On Rails :)

## Subject
The objective of the test is to create a small project exposing a RESTful API. We will be testing
this API by using a client like Postman.
While we encourage using the Ruby on Rails framework, it is not mandatory and the test can be
written using any language and framework you would like. We also encourage you to write
some unit tests, as it is something of importance to us, but it is again not mandatory.
Youâ€™ll have to download a CSV file (linked below) and this file will be used as your seed data to
feel your database.
You will then need to create and expose an API allowing us to do the CRUD (Create, Read,
Update, Delete) actions. We would also like to be able to consult a paginated list of all the
Pokemon in the file.


## Implementation
I choose to go with Ruby On Rails, and I kept the included solution for testing to make things easier for me.

Notes: I implemented a lot of layer on top of each others as I learned more about how to do things properly: basic REST API, validation layer for the model, then validation / error handling, etc.
Because of this the project is not as tested, as safe, nor as clean as I would want to. But hey I'm still learning :)
